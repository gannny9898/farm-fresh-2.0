This guide explains how to log in as an administrator in the Farm Fresh application.

## Admin Credentials

Use the following credentials to log in as an admin:

- **Email**: admin@example.com
- **Password**: admin123

## Login Steps

1. Navigate to the login page by clicking on the "Login" link in the navigation bar or by going directly to `login.html`.

2. Enter the admin credentials:
   - Email: admin@example.com
   - Password: admin123

3. Click the "Login" button.

4. You will be redirected to the admin dashboard where you'll have full access to:
   - User management
   - Order management
   - Product management
   - System analytics
   - Data export functionality

## Admin Privileges

As an admin, you have the following privileges:

- View and manage all users
- View and manage all orders
- View and manage all products
- Access to system analytics
- Export all data
- Delete users and products
- Update order statuses

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues logging in:

1. Make sure you're using the correct credentials (admin@example.com / admin123)
2. Check if the mock API is properly loaded (check browser console)
3. Try clearing your browser's localStorage and refreshing the page
4. Ensure all required JavaScript files are loaded (check browser console for errors)

## Security Note

In a production environment, admin access should be properly secured with:
- Strong password requirements
- Two-factor authentication
- Secure session management
- IP restrictions
- Activity logging

This is a development/demo environment, so these security measures are not implemented.
